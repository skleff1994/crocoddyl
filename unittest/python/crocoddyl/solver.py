class SolverAbstract:
    """ Abstract class for optimal control solvers.

    In crocoddyl, a solver resolves an optimal control solver which is formulated in a problem abstraction. The main
    routines are computeDirection and tryStep. The former finds a search direction and typically computes the
    derivatives of each action model. The latter rollout the dynamics and cost (i.e. the action) to try the search
    direction found by computeDirection. Both functions used the current guess defined by setCandidate. Finally solve
    function is used to define when the search direction and length are computed in each iterate. It also describes
    the globalization strategy (i.e. regularization) of the numerical optimization.
